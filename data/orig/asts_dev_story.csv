organisms use it for communication and for attracting prey but jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators , to , uh , to startle them but jellyfish closer to the surface , probably like the jellyfish you saw , they use bioluminescence to hide the light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight , so they blend in , and , uh , and predators can't see them wow , really ?"", ""well , i am looking for a topic for my term paper , so maybe i could do it on these glowing jellyfish that's why i wanted to ask you about them , you know , to find out if there was really something to write about it's a great topic but you ii have to make sure the topic is manageable like i said , about half of all jellyfish are bioluminescent , so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence in the same way , or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence , on , on the chemical process , or here's an idea you seem to be very involved in local issues see if youcan identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the

ads tapping into people's environmental concerns ."", 'but some green marketers learned the hard way , green marketing must still involve all the same principles of a traditional marketing campaign

marketing campaign that failed at first and explain why .', 'it was a compact fluorescent light bulb .', ""we'll call it the eco light ."", ""it was first introduced , i believe , in the late 9's ."",

effective and convenient because it doesn't have to be changed every few months ."", 'this ad campaign worked like a charm .', ""something else , uh , the company that makes the co light , researchers would consider it an extreme green company , not only because its product are energy efficient , but because the company tries to reduce its environmental impact in other ways too like in addition to selling earth friendly products , its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and use all sorts of recycled materials a company that only recycles office paper , researchers would classify as a lean green company and there are other degrees of greenness in between so if your green marketing strategy's gonna work , your message should be valid on all dimensions when a company as

biological , important nutritive function in those organisms and one trace metal that serves a nutritive function is zinc zinc assists in a number of processes in humans , but we are going to focus on just one , one that applies to a number of organisms , not just humans see , zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling , the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon , iike carbon dioxide , into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use so , take respiration our bodies , our cells produce carbon dioxide when theybreak down sugars we need to get the co2 out of our bodies , so the co2 is converted into carbonic acid , which the blood is able to carry to the lungs once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs , it's converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out now , this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme uh , who remembers what an enzyme is ?"", 'bob ?', ""uh , it's a protein , a specific kind of protein , one that speeds up chemical reactions ."", ""exactly different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions now , the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it so this zinc enzyme is critical for getting co2 out of our bodies through the lungs and it's also extremely important for plants bob , can you tell us why ?"", 'for making food , for photosynthesis ?', ""exactly for photosynthesis plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans so zinc is also important for plants ok but zinc is scarce in certain environments and it's particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans , which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all in fact , there are a lot of marine plants that survive , that grow and reproduce in surface waters in particular , there are a lot of diatoms diatoms are microscopic , photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean there are a number of different types of diatoms , and , well , diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process , because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean the carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten , say , by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean , or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor ."", 'so how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce ?', ""well , recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a different enzyme that serves the same purpose but this enzyme doesn't contain zinc instead this new enzyme incorporates another trace metal , cadmium kelly , you've got a question ?"", ""yeah i thought cadmium was toxic didn't you say that ?"", 'it is poisonous to humans uh .', ""actually , we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life , that it didn't serve any biological purpose but new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc , that organisms can use it instead of zinc when there isn't enough zinc in their environment now , the discovery of this cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons it's actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium so it's possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes , that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce and there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmiumbut there's something else to think about what is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere , one of the major culprits in global warming carbon dioxide , right ?"", ""now , if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface , converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean , well , maybe there's more to that whole process , that cycle , something that we've overlooked so further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too .""]",1.2

about orbits , especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again , predictably , after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system , goes in close to the sun , and then out again at its closest approach to the sun , halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are , which puts it out beyond neptune ."", ""basically , the idea here is that a periodic comet , with its very elongated orbit , just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet , well , it returns every 75 years , roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?"", ""well , like all orbiting bodies , a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood , inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit , poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this , we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years , first on its way in toward the sun , and then on its way out again now , you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus , its core , is made up of ice and dust , like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun , it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet , the comet never collects them back again , so on every orbit , the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system ?"", 'four and a half billion years remember ?', ""and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now , right ?"", ""i mean , how come halley's is still there ?"", 'after four and a half billion years how could it be ?', ""well , the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit , since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well , that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer ."", ""so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that , going toward the sun and then come back around , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in , pass behind the sun , and then travel back out but with an orbit so large , and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually , but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically , we can't determine it so we just , we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so , what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?"", 'well , gravitational interaction with planets , right ?', ""lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets , then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit , maybe make it much shorter so this comet , if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way , it can be drawn into a new orbit , one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often .""]",0.5

conservation it also involves what ?', ""um preserving other types of cultural materials toovery good not just art old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies , all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2 years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes writing was discovered now , a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest , as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise , called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems , which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today , but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago , the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately , the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?"", ""um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?"", ""true and some are moldy , and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?"", 'take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?', 'well ?', 'they used parchment to write on , but yes , there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?', ""correct then even later on in the twentieth century , a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately , that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?"", ""ah , that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists , isn't it ?"", ""to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings , pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just pop off the page the original text and diagrams emerged line by line diagram after diagram ."", ""and that's kind of typical of our field there's a lot of interdisciplinary work people from several different fields might beinvolved in working with a single art .""]",1.2

in a number of processes in humans , but we are going to focus on just one , one that applies to a number of organisms , not just humans see , zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling , the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon , iike carbon dioxide , into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use so , take respiration our bodies , our cells produce carbon dioxide when theybreak down sugars we need to get the co2 out of our bodies , so the co2 is converted into carbonic acid , which the blood is able to carry to the lungs once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs , it's converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out now , this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme uh , who remembers what an enzyme is ?"", 'bob ?', ""uh , it's a protein , a specific kind of protein , one that speeds up chemical reactions ."", ""exactly different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions now , the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it so this zinc enzyme is critical for getting co2 out of our bodies through the lungs and it's also extremely important for plants bob , can you tell us why ?"", 'for making food , for photosynthesis ?', ""exactly for photosynthesis plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans so zinc is also important for plants ok but zinc is scarce in certain environments and it's particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans , which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all in fact , there are a lot of marine plants that survive , that grow and reproduce in surface waters in particular , there are a lot of diatoms diatoms are microscopic , photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean there are a number of different types of diatoms , and , well , diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process , because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean the carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten , say , by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean , or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor ."", 'so how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce ?', ""well , recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a

cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons it's actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium so it's possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes , that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce and there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmiumbut there's something else to think about what is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere , one of the major culprits in global warming carbon dioxide , right ?"", ""now , if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface , converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean , well , maybe there's more to that whole process , that cycle , something that we've overlooked so

about the structure of comets let's continue our discussion now by talking about orbits , especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again , predictably , after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system , goes in close to the sun , and then out again at its closest approach to the sun , halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are , which puts it out beyond neptune ."", ""basically , the idea here is that a periodic comet , with its very elongated orbit , just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet , well , it returns every 75 years , roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?"", ""well , like all orbiting bodies , a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood , inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit , poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this , we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years , first on its way in toward the sun , and then on its way out again now , you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus , its core , is made up of ice and dust , like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun , it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet , the comet never collects them back again , so on every orbit , the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system ?"", 'four and a half billion years remember ?', ""and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now , right ?"", ""i mean , how come halley's is still there ?"", 'after four and a half billion years how could it be ?', ""well , the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit , since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well , that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer ."", ""so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that , going toward the sun and then come back around , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in , pass behind the sun , and then travel back out but with an orbit so large , and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually , but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically , we can't determine it so we just , we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so , what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?"", 'well , gravitational interaction with planets , right ?', ""lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets , then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit , maybe make it much shorter so this comet , if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way , it can be drawn into a new orbit , one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often .""]",1.5

are very valuable when they represent early technologies , all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2 years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes writing was discovered now , a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest , as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise , called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems , which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today , but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago , the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately , the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?"", ""um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?"", ""true and some are moldy , and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?"", 'take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?', 'well ?', 'they used parchment to write on , but yes , there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?', ""correct then even later on in the twentieth century , a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately , that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?"", ""ah , that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists , isn't it ?"", ""to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings , pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just

the view that our knowledge claims , what we think we know , that is , they need to have a base .', 'and think of knowledge as a house , you need a solid foundation on which to build your house .', 'and if you have a strong foundation , your house is more likely to be solid .', 'well , foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge .', 'if you have a solid base for your knowledge claims , then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong , valid , true .', 'first , you need some good foundational knowledge claims , and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these .', ""now , as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational , well , that's where this gets particularly interesting , in fact it sort of depends on which philosopher you ask ."", 'take john locke for instance .', ""locke's viewpoint essentially was that when humans are born , their minds are like blank slates , that is , we don't have any kind of knowledge when we are born ."", 'we get our knowledge from our senses , you know , taste , touch , smell , sight , hearing .', ""so , when we look at the world , first as babies and then as we grow , that's where our knowledge comes from ."", 'our senses , our experiences serve as the foundation for our knowledge .', ""now , for a very different view , let's turn to another philosopher ren descartes ."", 'descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations .', 'he believed that our senses are not to be trusted .', 'so he wanted to find a more solid foundation for knowledge .', 'he began with what has come to be called methodological doubt .', 'and when we say methodological doubt , well descartes believed that everything should be questioned , that is , approach it with doubt and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false , that one thing would serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims .', 'so unlike john locke , descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses .', 'he points out that at some time or another , everyone has been deceived by their senses .', 'we have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong illusions , perhaps , mirages .', 'when driving in a car on a hot summer day , you may see what looks like shimmering water on the road , which , as science tells us , is really just a mirage , an illusion caused by the heating of the air .', ""our senses are wrong , they've deceived us ."", 'and descartes thinks that since our senses can deceive us , we ought not take for granted that what they tell us is really true .', ""that's the first step in his methodological doubt ."", 'from there he wonders , well , ok , i can doubt my senses , but can i doubt that i am sitting in this room ?', 'can it seem that we are not really here ?', 'that we are somewhere else ?', 'he conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room .', ""but then he says , well , couldn't i just be dreaming ?"", ""he's had dreams that were so real that he thought he was awake when in fact he was actually asleep ."", 'and this is another good point .', ""it's really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming ."", ""yet another proof

picture of reality , that the world is really the way it looks to us , descartes shows that we cannot just assume this to be true beyond all doubt .', 'and he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming .', 'but consider this , he says , while one is thinking or doubting , or doing any of those sorts of mental activities , one has to exist , right ?', 'to even think that i doubt that i exist , you have to exist !', 'and so what descartes has done is find at least one thing that he can be certain of .', 'he says , i exist .', ""and that's a start ."",

important nutritive function in those organisms and one trace metal that serves a nutritive function is zinc zinc assists in a number of processes in humans , but we are going to focus on just one , one that applies to a number of organisms , not just humans see , zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling , the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon , iike carbon dioxide , into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use so , take respiration our bodies , our cells produce carbon dioxide when theybreak down sugars we need to get the co2 out of our bodies , so the co2 is converted into carbonic acid , which the blood is able to carry to the lungs once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs , it's converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out now , this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme uh , who remembers what an enzyme is ?"", 'bob ?', ""uh , it's a protein , a specific kind of protein , one that speeds up chemical reactions ."", ""exactly different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions now , the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it so this zinc enzyme is critical for getting co2 out of our bodies through the lungs and it's also extremely important for plants bob , can you tell us why ?"", 'for making food , for photosynthesis ?', ""exactly for photosynthesis plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans so zinc is also important for plants ok but zinc is scarce in certain environments and it's particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans , which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all in fact , there are a lot of marine plants that survive , that grow and reproduce in surface waters in particular , there are a lot of diatoms diatoms are microscopic , photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean there are a number of different types of diatoms , and , well , diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process , because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean the carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten , say , by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean , or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor ."", 'so how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce ?', ""well , recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a different enzyme that serves the same purpose but this enzyme doesn't contain zinc instead this new enzyme incorporates another trace metal , cadmium kelly , you've got a question ?"", ""yeah i thought cadmium was toxic didn't you say that ?"", 'it is poisonous to humans uh .', ""actually , we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life , that it didn't serve any biological purpose but new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc , that organisms can use it instead of zinc when there isn't enough zinc in their environment now , the discovery of this cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons it's actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium so it's possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes , that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce and there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmiumbut there's something else to think about what is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere , one of the major culprits in global warming carbon dioxide , right ?"", ""now , if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface , converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean , well , maybe there's more to that whole process , that cycle , something that we've overlooked so further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too .""]",1.0

about orbits , especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again , predictably , after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system , goes in close to the sun , and then out again at its closest approach to the sun , halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are , which puts it out beyond neptune ."", ""basically , the idea here is that a periodic comet , with its very elongated orbit , just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet , well , it returns every 75 years , roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?"", ""well , like all orbiting bodies , a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood , inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit , poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this , we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years , first on its way in toward the sun , and then on its way out again now , you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus , its core , is made up of ice and dust , like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun , it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet , the comet never collects them back again , so on every orbit , the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system ?"", 'four and a half billion years remember ?', ""and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now , right ?"", ""i mean , how come halley's is still there ?"", 'after four and a half billion years how could it be ?', ""well , the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit , since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well , that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer ."", ""so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that , going toward the sun and then come back around , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in , pass behind the sun , and then travel back out but with an orbit so large , and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually , but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically , we can't determine it so we just , we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so , what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?"", 'well , gravitational interaction with planets , right ?', ""lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets , then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit , maybe make it much shorter so this comet , if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way , it can be drawn into a new orbit , one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often .""]",0.0

it also involves what ?', ""um preserving other types of cultural materials toovery good not just art old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies , all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2 years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes writing was discovered now , a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest , as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise , called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems , which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today , but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago , the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately , the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?"", ""um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?"", ""true and some are moldy , and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?"", 'take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?', 'well ?', 'they used parchment to write on , but yes , there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?', ""correct then even later on in the twentieth century , a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately , that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?"", ""ah , that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists , isn't it ?"", ""to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings , pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just pop off the page the original text and diagrams emerged line by line diagram after

selling earth friendly products , its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and use all sorts of recycled materials a company that only recycles office paper , researchers would classify as a lean green company and there are other degrees of greenness in between so if your green marketing strategy's gonna work , your message should be valid on all dimensions when a company as

smaller members of our solar system , comets you already know about the structure of comets let's continue our discussion now by talking about orbits , especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again , predictably , after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system , goes in close to the sun , and then out again at its closest approach to the sun , halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are , which puts it out beyond neptune ."", ""basically , the idea here is that a periodic comet , with its very elongated orbit , just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet , well , it returns every 75 years , roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?"", ""well , like all orbiting bodies , a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood , inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit , poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this , we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years , first on its way in toward the sun , and then on its way out again now , you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus , its core , is made up of ice and dust , like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun , it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet , the comet never collects them back again , so on every orbit , the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system ?"", 'four and a half billion years remember ?', ""and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now , right ?"", ""i mean , how come halley's is still there ?"", 'after four and a half billion years how could it be ?', ""well , the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit , since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well , that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer ."", ""so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that , going toward the sun and then come back around , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in , pass behind the sun , and then travel back out but with an orbit so large , and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually , but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically , we can't determine it so we just , we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so , what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?"", 'well , gravitational interaction with planets , right ?', ""lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets , then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit , maybe make it much shorter so this comet , if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way , it can be drawn into a new orbit , one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often .""]",1.2

types of cultural materials toovery good not just art old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies , all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2 years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes writing was discovered now , a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest , as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise , called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems , which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today , but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago , the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars

shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?"", ""um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?"", ""true and some are moldy , and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?"", 'take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?', 'well ?', 'they used parchment to write on , but yes , there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?', ""correct then even later on in the twentieth century , a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older

recovered ?"", ""ah , that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists , isn't it ?"", ""to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings , pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the

"[""k we have been looking at some of the smaller members of our solar system , comets you already know about the structure of comets let's continue our discussion now by talking about orbits , especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again , predictably , after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system , goes in close to the sun , and then out again at its closest approach to the sun , halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are , which puts it out beyond neptune ."", ""basically , the idea here is that a periodic comet , with its very elongated orbit , just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet , well , it returns every 75 years , roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?"", ""well , like all orbiting bodies , a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood , inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit , poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this , we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years , first on its way in toward the sun , and then on its way out again now , you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus , its core , is made up of ice and dust , like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun , it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet , the comet never collects them back again , so on every orbit , the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system ?"", 'four and a half billion years remember ?', ""and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now , right ?"", ""i mean , how come halley's is still there ?"", 'after four and a half billion years how could it be ?', ""well , the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit , since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well , that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer ."", ""so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that , going toward the sun and then come back around , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in , pass behind the sun , and then travel back out but with an orbit so large , and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually , but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically , we can't determine it so we just , we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so , what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?"", 'well , gravitational interaction with planets , right ?', ""lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets , then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit , maybe make it much shorter so this comet , if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way , it can be drawn into a new orbit , one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often .""]","['so far we have been talking all semester about restoring and preserving pieces of art like ancient frescos early oil paintings etc but although our field is called art conservation

physical reasoning back to maths problems , which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today , but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago , the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately , the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?"", ""um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?"", ""true and some are moldy , and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?"", 'take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?', 'well ?', 'they used parchment to write on , but yes , there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?', ""correct then even later on in the twentieth century , a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately , that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?"", ""ah , that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists , isn't it ?"", ""to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings , pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just pop off the page the original text and diagrams emerged line by line diagram after diagram ."",

today , let's try to get an idea about , well , a question that's not addressed as much as the others and that's what was their culture like ?"", 'and how do we figure that out ?', ""now , again , there's a great debate about when the clovis people first arrived in the americas ."", ""and i am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back , so let's use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11 , years ago ."", 'the clovis people were likely settling north america 11 , years ago .', 'and leave it at that for now .', 'now , most of what we know about the clovis people comes from one of their tools the clovis point .', ""when we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that's worked to a sharp point , in this case probably to be attached to a spear ."", 'the clovis point may be the most analyzed artifact in archaeology .', ""and the point used by clovis people differs slightly from later points , in the way that the base of the stone is thinned , uh , it's thinner toward the base , the part that's attached to the spear ."", ""so when one is found , it's usually not confused with points made by later groups ."", 'clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites , which you might expect .', 'but another fascinating place we find them is in clovis caches .', 'a cache is just something stored or hidden away .', ""it's also the term for the place where it's hidden ."", 'the clovis caches are collections of tools , stone points and other tools made of stone or bone , often at various stages of manufacturing , some were left unfinished .', 'the traditional explanation is that these were emergency supplies , uh , meant to be used at a later time .', ""since the clovis people were highly mobile , it's plausible that they would set up spots along established travel routes where they keep a variety of items ."", ""either so that they wouldn't have to carry everything with them or so they could save time once they arrived at a site by not having to make stuff from scratch ."", ""but there's another theory about the caches based on the quality of some of the points we've found ."", 'you see , the points in some caches differ from other points , from points at clovis camp sites for example .', ""for one thing , these cache points are quite large , up to twice as large as regular points , so big that you couldn't attach one to a spear say , and expect to throw the spear accurately over any distance ."", 'so what were they for ?', 'well , it was originally thought that they were unfinished , that someone was working away a point , then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later .', ""the problem is it's unlikely that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches , that would be a lot of stone to chip away ."", 'a toolmaker starts with a smaller piece .', 'and actually , far from being unfinished , a lot of these points really show excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail .', 'and not just with respect to the skill , but also with respect to the raw material , it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone .', 'so we have to ask could these points have served another purpose ?', ""maybe be they weren't just tools ."", 'look at it this way .', 'when the clovis people first arrived in the americas , they had a lot to learn about their new environment .', 'over time , they would have begun to recognize some places as special , important for some reason .', 'maybe there was always water available there .', 'or the hunting was especially good .', 'so maybe the cache was a way to mark the place as significant .']","[""today let's begin to look at structural engineering in the space age ."", 'uh , new problems new possibilities mean we can think in new ways , find radically different approaches .', ""so let's consider uh , well , what would you say is the biggest obstacle today to putting structures , equipment , people uh , anything really , into space ?"", 'well , the cost , right ?', 'exactly .', 'i mean , just taking the space shuttle up and back one time is hugely expensive .', 'uh , why ?', 'i guess a lot of it is for fuel , right ?', 'to to get the rocket going fast enough .', 'good .', ""so we are burning up an enormous amount of fuel at every launch just to get the rocket up to what's known as escape velocity ."", 'now , escape velocity is around 11 kilometers a second , pretty fast .', 'but do we really have to go this fast ?', 'well , yeah .', 'i mean , how else can you , um escape ?', ""i mean , that's the whole point of escape velocity , right ?"", 'otherwise gravity will pull you back down to the earth .', ""actually , that's a common misconception ."", ""escape velocity is simply the speed of an object that's uh , let's say , shot out of a cannon the minimum initial speed so that the object could later escape earth's gravity on its own ."", ""but that's just if there's no additional force being applied ."", 'if you keep on supplying force to the object , keep on pushing it upward .', ""it could pull away from earth's gravity at any speed ."", 'even really slow ?', ""so you're saying like , if you had a ladder tall enough , you could just climb into space ?"", 'yeah !', 'uh , well , theoretically .', 'i mean , i can see some practical problems with the ladder example .', ""uh , like you might get just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so , uh , especially with all the oxygen tanks you'll have to be hauling up with you ."", 'no .', 'i was thinking more along the lines of an elevator .', 'wait !', 'you are serious ?', 'sure .', 'an elevator .', ""that's a new idea to most of us , but in fact it's been around for over a century ."", 'if we could power such an elevator with solar energy , we could simply rise up into space for a fraction of the cost of a trip by rocket or shuttle .', ""but wait , elevators don't just rise up ."", 'it have sic to hang on some kind of wire or track or something .', 'uh , true .', ""and for decades that's exactly what's prevented the idea from being feasible or even just taken seriously ."", 'where do we find the material strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a cable or track .', 'i mean , we are talking 36 , kilometers here .', 'and the strain on the cable would be more than most materials could bear .', ""but a new material developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond , yet it's much more flexible ."", 'i am talking about carbon nanotubes .', 'ok .', ""i've read something about carbon nanotubes ."", ""they are strong , alright , but aren't they just very short little cylinders in shape ?"", 'ah , yes .', 'but these cylinders cling together at a molecular level .', ""you pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes , and its neighbor's come with it , and their neighbors , and so on ."", 'so you could actually draw out a 36 , kilometer strand or ribbon of nanotubes stronger than steel , but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair .', 'ok .', 'fine .', ""but what's going to hold this ribbon up and keep it reach enough to support an elevator car ?"", 'well , we definitely have to anchor it at both ends .', 'so what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the equator and a satellite in geostationary orbit around the earth .', ""there's a reason i mentioned that figure of 36 , kilometers ."", ""that's about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the equator to constantly remain directly above the exact same spot on the rotating planet earth ."", 'so once you are in this geostationary orbit right over the tower , just lower your carbon nanotube cable down from the satellite , tether it to the tower here on earth .', 'and there you have it !', 'so you really think this is a possibility ?', 'like , how soon could it happen ?', 'well , the science fiction writer arthur c .', ""clarke talked about building a space elevator back in the 197's ."", 'and when someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality , his reply was , probably about fifty years after everybody quits laughing .', 'http discovermagazine .', 'com 2 9 jul aug 9 ways carbon nanotubes just might rock world .']",0.5
