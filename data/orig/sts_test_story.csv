efficiently transferred into the water , with minimal reflection .', 'the only other place , this special fatty tissue , like that in the melon , the only other place is found in the dolphin , is in the lower jaw .', 'turns out that the lower jaw , well , it is made of a specially thin bone .', 'and it is very sensitive to vibrations , to sound energy traveling through the seawater .', ""it turns
